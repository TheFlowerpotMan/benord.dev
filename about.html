      <p class="card-text">My name is Ben Ord, I am 30-years-old, married with three children and we live in Ephrata Pennsylvania. I have been a software developer for 5 years or so and it has been a wild ride. In 2016 I started taking online web development classes with which I was able to secure an internship as a developer. A year later that became a full-time development position, writing geospatial applications for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and that is what I am still doing today.
        In the last 5 years my wife and I have also had 3 children, bought a house, I have almost completed an associated in Web development and we worked with a small website building company on the side. There has been a lot of hard times but through it all I have learned the value of hard work, commitment and determination.
        I like to bring creativity to the work I do whether that is development or fixing my house and I am a firm believer in making sure that what I do benefits others, not just myself. In my spare time I love to play ultimate frisbee and disc golf, I also play guitar and drums and as a family we love to walk, hike and visit the beach.
