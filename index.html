    <div class="about-text">My name is Ben Ord, I am 30-years-old, married with three children and we live in Ephrata
      Pennsylvania. I have been a software developer for 5 years or so and it has been a wild ride. In 2016 I started
      taking online web development classes with which I was able to secure an internship as a developer. A year later
      that became a full-time development position, writing geospatial applications for the Pennsylvania Department of
      Transportation and that is what I am still doing today.
      In the last 5 years my wife and I have also had 3 children, bought a house, I have almost completed an associated
      in Web development and we worked with a small website building company on the side. There has been a lot of hard
      times but through it all I have learned the value of hard work, commitment and determination.
      I like to bring creativity to the work I do whether that is development or fixing my house and I am a firm
      believer in making sure that what I do benefits others, not just myself. In my spare time I love to play ultimate
      frisbee and disc golf, I also play guitar and drums and as a family we love to walk, hike and visit the beach.
